# CookieMonster
A Discord bot designed to keep track of the important things in life - cookies!

This was a bot created for the Staffordshire University Discord server. It is currently a dead project, however I plan to revisit it shortly in the future to add additional features.

## SET UP INSTRUCTIONS
The bot WILL NOT run without a config.xml file. This holds all of the customizable attributes for the bot, and is stored in the root of this project. Ensure you put a config.xml into the root of the execution folder.

You will also need to download the Discord.NET package, a handy C# wrapper available here: https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net (you can also use NuGet)
